Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others \"\"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system\"\", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with \"\"- For a start,\"\" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in \"\"the clearest possible words\"\" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss \"\"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)\"\", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about.

It's that people like you seem to enjoy (whether or not your side gets it right) to discuss, turn, twist and frankly abuse topics like this which is detrimental to the basic goals of Wikis in general and Wikipedia in particular. As John Stewart said to two hacks; You're hurting us. Also, frankly, you're the one being passive aggressive. If you're going to give your opinion about someone, or even insult them, don't beat around the bush. You're the one being exactly what passive aggressive entails:, calling him *indirectly* ignorant of your (the groups) rules, acting in an elitist and authoritarian manner, calling him childish, indirectly threatening him with administrative action and so forth. I repeat, you are a douche. 213.100.108.117  \"\n",
